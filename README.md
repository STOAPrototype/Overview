# STOA Prototype

**Public-Interest Infrastructure for Digital Trust and Accountability**

---

### Overview

**STOA** (System for Transparent and Open Accountability) is an applied research initiative exploring how we can rebuild trust online through **portable, human-centered governance models**.  
This prototype demonstrates the core architecture of STOA â€” combining the **Canonical Social Object Model (CSOM)** with an **Ethical Decision Model** designed for fairness, explainability, and contextual integrity.

We believe that moderation, transparency, and digital rights should not depend on a single platformâ€™s rules. STOA is an open framework that allows users, NGOs, and platforms to **carry their own moderation packs**, audit algorithmic outcomes, and simulate ethical trade-offs across different contexts.

### Components

1. **CSOM (Canonical Social Object Model)**  
   A semantic schema that standardizes how posts, comments, context, and moderation decisions are represented â€” enabling interoperability across networks.

2. **Ethical Decision Model (EDM)**  
   A Python-based model that applies **fairness-aware machine learning** and **CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)** simulation to assess the ethical tail-risks of moderation or algorithmic decisions.

3. **Validation Pipeline**  
   A transparent evaluation process that includes reproducible metrics, ablation testing, and documentation for research replication.

### Research Goals (Year 1)

- Build and validate the **ethical-decision model**, connecting it to the CSOM schema.  
- Develop a **simulation environment** for testing fairness, explainability, and accountability in real-world moderation scenarios.  
- Design an open repository for **reproducible research** in algorithmic ethics and governance.
